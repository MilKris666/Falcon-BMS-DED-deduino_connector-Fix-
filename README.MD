Since July 2025, the DEDuino Connector app has been crashing on startup. I looked into the issue and found that the app tries to check for updates when it starts. Because the update URL is no longer available, it crashes. As a quick fix, I simply changed the URL to google.com, which was enough to get the app running again.

Iâ€™ve also included a precompiled .exe file in the ZIP archive.
